A [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)) actually refers to a collection, of electrochemical cells, and it is the electrochemical cell we need to understand. (The term battery actually predates the electrochemical cell and was first used by [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin), to describe a number of connected capacitors, which at this time were [Leyden Jars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar)). The electrochemical cell was invented by [Alessandro Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta), but he did not fully appreciate the chemical nature of it's operation, which was understood somewhat later by [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday).\n"

    "\n",
    "Volta's invention of the battery was inspired by the discovery of [Luigi Galvani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Galvani) that when a dissected frog's leg had was touched with two different metals it twitched and sparks were observed. Galvani thought that the energy came from the leg itself, and believed he had discovered “animal electricity”. Volta disagreed with this interpretation, and demonstrated that a voltage could be produced by different metals separated by a fluid. At first the potentials he achieved were small, but after some years of work he invented the Voltaic Pile in 1800, which consisted of pairs of copper and zinc discs separated by brine soaked sheets of cardboard. Volta's interpretation of the operation of the device, while an improvement on Galvani's animal electricity idea was incorrect; he thought that the potential came as a result of different materials touching each other and that the observed corrosion of the metals while the battery was operated was a side effect that could be avoided if only the right materials could be found, resulting in a perpetually operating battery.\n",

Each half cell has a characteristic voltage, determined by the nature of the electrode and electrolyte. When the two half cells are combined in to a full cell one electrode gains electrons due to an equilibirium reaction with the electrolyte, while the other loses them. These reactions are limited unless a current flows, as current flows through an external circuit the reactions are allowed to proceed, until the reach a point where the reaction cannot proceed any more and the battery is dead.\n",

    "When dealing with conductors in electrostatics we said there could not be a field inside a conductor. This is only true if there is no current flowing. If we consider a wire of length $l$ with a potential difference $V$ from one end to the other there will be a field inside the wire with magnitude $E=\\frac{V}{l}$.\n",

    "If we think about a microscopic picture of a conductor, we can imagine free electrons which move randomly at high speeds. When one applies a field to the electrons, they are accelerated in the direction opposite to the field (remember the current will be in the opposite direction to the net movement of the electrons). However their speed is limited by collisions with atoms in the wire. The velocity they achieve is called the [drift velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity) $\\vec{v}_{d}$ which will be directed against the direction of the field."

    "In a conventional conductor the mobility is limited by scattering events, but this is not the case in a [superconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity), where some electrons form  [Cooper pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair). These paired electrons can form a [Bose-Einstein Condensate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boseâ€“Einstein_condensate) (unlike regular electrons which cannot have the same quantum state due to the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle)). The key result that leads to zero resistance is that scattering events are quantum mechanically forbidden for electrons in the Bose-Einstein condensate because the amount of energy provided to an electron in a scattering event would not be sufficient for it exceed the minimum energy quantum mechanically required for it to leave the condensate."

With a Wheatstone bridge the value of a unknown resistor $R_{x}$ can be measured to high precision by the use of an adjustable resistor, $R_{3}$. The idea is that when there is zero potential measured across the voltmeter in the middle of the bridge, the values of $R_{3}$ and $R_{x}$ are the same.

A Galvanometer is a meter which measures a small current based on electromagnetic induction (we'll come back to this later!). For an ammeter a shunt resistor is placed in parallel to allow most of the current to flow through the shunt. For a voltmeter a resistor is placed in series to reduce the total amount of current that flows through the meter. As the resistor of the galvanometer itself is known the actual current or voltage can be worked out  (the meter scale usually takes care of this automatically!).\n",

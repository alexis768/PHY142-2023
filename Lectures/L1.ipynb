    "### Static Electricity\n",
    "\n",
    "[static electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_electricity) describes a build up of charge on an object. We are all familiar with contact induced transfer of charge between objects or [Triboelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboelectric_effect)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ancient Greeks knew that amber rubbed with wool would then attract small objects, and the word electricity comes from this effect the (Greek word for amber is elektron). However to understand why such a thing should happen we need to invoke our modern understanding of atomic structure.\n",
    "[Amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber) is fossilized tree resin and is a macromolecule formed by the polymerization of different carbon compounds found in tree resin. The atoms in these compounds have fairly empty outer shells. In common with many modern plastics this means it has a tendency to pick up electrons and develop a negative electric charge when put into contact with a materials that has loosely bound electrons. Fur, hair, silk and synthetic fibres such as nylon tend to be on the other side of the series, ie. they readily give up electrons to develop a positive charge. Glass and human skin are also examples of materials that readily acquire a positive charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rubbing that we normally associate with building up static is not essential for charge transfer, it simply generates a large number of contact-decontact events which allow charge to be transferred from one object to the other.\n",

    "### Examples of Triboelectric effects:\n",

Usually the charge on an object is eventually dissipated by contact with water (which is a polar molecule) in the atmosphere. You are much more likely to get static shock on a dry day!\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in a good conductor, such as a metal, the electrons are free to move around, and will therefore, if the metal object is isolated, distribute themselves uniformly on the surface of the object (given that like charges repel and they would like to be as far away from each other as possible).\n",

To be able to determine the sign of the charge on an object some of the charge should be transferred to the electroscope and then an object with known charge should be brought in to proximity to the electroscope. The sign of the charge can then be deduced from the reaction of the electroscope. The reverse is also true, if the sign of charge on an electroscope is known it can be used to determine the sign of charge on an unknown object.\n",

As the battery runs down the potential difference stays fairly constant, but the amount of charge available decreases. There is a fixed amount of chemical potential energy available to be converted to electrical potential energy.\n",

The amount of charge separated is not large, so while there is a very large potential difference between the two terminals the amount of electrical potential energy produced by the machine is not very large. To understand why the potential is so large we will need to discuss capacitance (next week!). You can find a nice explanation here of [how the machine works](http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/whyhow.html).\n",

    "The positive charge we moved has gained potential energy $\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}}\\frac{Q^{2}}{d}$. However, it would actually be better to say that the system of charges has gained that electric potential energy, as we could just as easily have looked at this from the perspective of the moved charge. Either charge can move further away from the other and convert some of that potential energy in to some other form of energy. The closer the charges are to each other the more potential energy is available."

We would like a situation where a charged particle will lose potential energy in going from one terminal to another.

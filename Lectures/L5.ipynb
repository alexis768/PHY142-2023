In principle if we want to find the total field vector we need to integrate taking into account the direction.

When calculating fields by direct integration using the integral $E=\\int dE=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\int\\frac{dq}{r^{2}}$ the question we need to ask is, does the distance of the charge from the point where we want to know the field change as we move in the charge distribution? If so we need to express the distance $r$ from the charge in terms of the variable over which we are integrating (see the example of the line of charge in [L2)](https://github.com/marivifs-teaching/PHY142-2023/blob/main/Lectures/L2.ipynb).
